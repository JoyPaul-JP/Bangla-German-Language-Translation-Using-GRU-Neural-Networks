# Bangla-German-Language-Translation-Using-GRU-Neural-Networks
The project titled "Bangla German Language Translation Using GRU Neural Networks" focuses on developing a neural machine translation system capable of translating Bangla text into German. Five GRU-based architectures were implemented, including Simple GRU, Bi-directional GRU, Encoder-Decoder GRU, and Hybrid models, to evaluate performance across different design approaches. The models were implemented using Python in Google Colab and utilized libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and Scikit-learn for text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The translation system achieved BLEU scores ranging from 54.40% (unigram) to 85.88% (4-gram) and training accuracy between 80.36% and 85.69%, demonstrating strong translation quality in Bangla-German language pairs.
